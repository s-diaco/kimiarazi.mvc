# kimiarazi.mvc
A simple website using ASP.NET MVC and Bootstrap.
This is a multilanguage, multi-direction (ltr and rtl, english and persian) website. 
It uses asp.net mvc, bootstrap, a little sqlserver, jquery and html 5.
Over 90% of the text are stored in .resx files (not in the database) and changing the language doesn't need to change the template. just one css file and two fonts will change and the rest is .resx file.
A web.config rule will redirect any traffic from a non-www request to www address to improve SEO.
